Feature: Token and Storage test
  Check if the different features in Token API run as intended

  Scenario: Standard token issuing and using
    Given the user id, user name and the number of tokens
    When issuing tokens
    Then the tokens is not null
    And the token count provided should be "5"
    And the user is able to use the tokens
    And not use tokens beyond the provided ones

  Scenario: Tampering Tokens
   Given username "bro", userId "8273" and "1" number of tokens
   When retreving a set of tokens
   Then the token count is indeed "1"
   And the user can't tamper the token  - use a non existing token by injecting userid

  Scenario: Connecting to Mongo and standard use cases
  Given mongo datastore plus the standard username "knekk", userId "3433" and "1" number of tokens
  When providing tokens with mongo datastore
  Then tokens is not null
  And size is "1"
  And number of unused tokens is "1"
  And able to use token
  And the new number of unused tokens is "0"
  And not able to use tokens
